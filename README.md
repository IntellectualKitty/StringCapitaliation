# StringCapitalization

A small set of C++ string capitalization functions in the std namespace:

// Capitalize the first word: "hit the sack" -> "Hit the sack".
string cap_first_string( const char* s );

// Capitalize each word: "hit the sack" -> "Hit The Sack".
string cap_each_string( const char* s );

// Capitalize each letter: "hit the sack" -> "HIT THE SACK".
string all_caps_string( const char* s );

The intention of this starter repository is to support string capitalization -- and hopefully other mechanisms -- for easing, enhancing, and expanding C++ string support.  Ideally, this repository will be expanded into a full-fledged string utility library (and renamed as such).

Your support is greatly appreciated.  Please feel free to submit any functions and classes that support string creation, manipulation, processing, etc.

Best wishes and kind regards,
